## Questions

- Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?

In Supervised Learning, we used **Random Forest Classifier**, **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** and **Voting Classifier**

In Unsupervised Learning, we used **K-Means**

- How accurate is your solution of prediction?

Our highest accuracy was Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of between 85,5% and 88%

Closely followed by Voting Classifer of 84 to 85% and 80,95% for Naive Bayes

- Which are the most decisive factors for quitting a job?

The highest correlation we found was OverTime_Yes (24,6%), MaritalStatus_Single (17,54%), JobRole_Sales Representative (15,72%) and BusinessTravel_Travel_Frequently (11,51%) which all had a correlation of over 10%

- Which work positions and departments are in higher risk of losing employees?

- Are employees of different gender paid equally in all departments?

- Do the family status and the distance from work influence the work-life balance?

- Does education make people happy (satisfied from the work)?

- Which were the challenges in the project development?

When making the unsupervised models a bad result was returned. This caused confusion since a better result was expected, but after having spent time looking at both the input data and the output, a conclusion was made that the data just didn't fit the type of model. There was also the challenge of setting up the Streamlit application as it is a new library for the team. This required some experimenting which ultimately led to a better understanding of BI application development.
