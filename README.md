## Questions

- Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?

In Supervised Learning, we used **Random Forest Classifier**, **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** and **Voting Classifier**

In Unsupervised Learning, we used **K-Means**

- How accurate is your solution of prediction?

Our highest accuracy was Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of between 85,5% and 88%

Closely followed by Voting Classifer of 84 to 85% and 80,95% for Naive Bayes

- Which are the most decisive factors for quitting a job?

The highest correlation we found was OverTime_Yes (24,6%), MaritalStatus_Single (17,54%), JobRole_Sales Representative (15,72%) and BusinessTravel_Travel_Frequently (11,51%) which all had a correlation of over 10%

- Which work positions and departments are in higher risk of losing employees?

- Are employees of different gender paid equally in all departments?

- Do the family status and the distance from work influence the work-life balance?

- Does education make people happy (satisfied from the work)?

- Which were the challenges in the project development?

[x] Add many more comments
[ ] Check for outliers (Gaussian curves and z-score) (Maybe this can be automated?) (@Peter, take a look at this if you have time. Don't think outliers is a big concern)
[ ] Visualize data (@Peter, could you look at this?)
[x] Na√Øve Bayes fit
[x] Random Forest fit (Better than Decision tree)
[x] Voting fit
[x] K-Means fit (@Peter or @Yusuf, could you verify results?)
[ ] Make Streamlit app (@Peter, you are welcome to do this, but I should have time for making a small app tomorrow!)
